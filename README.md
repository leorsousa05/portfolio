# Leonardo Ribeiro Portfolio
Portfolio made by me for me.

The main purpose of this project wasn't really show my projects and show my CV but to test my abilities and show that i'm capable of working with Front-End development without the need of showing all the projects i have made. I'm creating this to show too that with the tecnologies we're given today, we can do whatever we want and i expect you all like, i'm putting time on this and i hope that the final website will be amazing.
